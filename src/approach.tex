\subsection{Methodology}

% formal proofs

% simulations 
% https://github.com/hans-m-song/harbergers-tax

% achieving nash equilibrium

\subsection{Potential Outcomes}

% resultant economy - profits for pool, profits for participants
% profitable - nice
% not as profitable - measure increased security vs loss of profit

\subsection{Limitations}

\paragraph{}

% simulation uses randomisation - can only generally model

% what if other pools buy chunks in this network? prove this is more profitable or that more people are willing to join this network instead of contributing to other pool
