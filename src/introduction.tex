\subsection{Background Coverage}

% literature review

\subsubsection{Blockchains}

% general background of what blockchains are

% blocks, hashes, byzantine fault tolerance

% scoping to pow or broader?

% centralisation of computation - 51\% attack

% incentives to mine - block reward - (hardware cost + power cost)

\subsubsection{Harbergers Tax}

% incentivisation of proper pricing and to sell

\subsection{Justification} % statement of purpose?

% decentralisation of computation - may be less profitable but more secure

% block reward, block time, market cap

\paragraph{Pool}
