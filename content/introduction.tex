\begin{itemize}
  \item proof of work blockchains take a lot of power \ignore{cite}
  \item miners band together into pools to increase chance of earning \textit{some} of the reward

  \item dependent on pool supervisor
  \item pool supervisor could attempt an attack / selfish mining
  \item payout is dependent on pool policy
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item decentralization of computation - may be less profitable but more secure

  \item pool manager can focus on efficiency / deduping calculations as they are incentivized to attract more participants
\end{itemize}
