\subsection{Milestones}

\paragraph{} Milestones outlined below will be used to judge the progress of the project. A Gantt chart of the below milestones and assessment items can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:gantt}

\subsubsection{Formal Modelling}

\paragraph{} Firstly, the game must be deconstructed into components and their relationships. This is required to not only define the general scope of simulatable interactions, but also to provide a foundation on which to abstract behaviours that may be difficult to model deterministically.

\subsubsection{Implement Model Simulation}

\paragraph{} As there are many adjustable parameters that may have a large impact on the balance and potentially several probabilistic factors, a simulation provides an avenue of automated experiementation to explore and evaluate the model.

\paragraph{Implement Model Logic}

\paragraph{} The mathematical model must be implemented with special considerations to the probabilistic properties of the auction. \comment{not sure about this} JavaScript was the chosen language to implement due to its event driven concurrency model. This milestone includes the implementation of the individual entities, interactions based on the mathematical model, and the event driven auction system.

\paragraph{Visualize Simulation Results}

\paragraph{} As there will be a large volume of data from the simulations with many dimensions, there is a requirement for aggregation and visualization in order to effectively analyse the data.

\subsubsection{Optimise Model Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Calculus???
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Derive Nash Equilibrium}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item formal proofs
  \item simulations
    \begin{itemize}
      \item async?
      \item how probabilistic?
      \item static intervals?
    \end{itemize}
  \item variability - whether or not to participate, amount to bid, changes in pools computational share, nodes having different compute power
  \item people withdrawing/depositing?, people joining/leaving?
  \item auction for each chunk owned or single chunk per round?
  \item achieving nash equilibrium
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item resultant economy - profits for pool, profits for participants
    \begin{itemize}
      \item profitable - nice (quantitative results)
      \item not as profitable - measure increased security vs loss of profit (need some qualitative work too)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item simulation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item modeling can only rely on randomization (although could fit to something like gaussian)
      \item
    \end{itemize}
  \item what if other pools buy chunks in this network? prove this is more profitable or that more people are willing to join this network instead of contributing to other pool
  \item how to get pools to opt into this over doing a 51% attack? how to get individuals to opt in?
\end{itemize}
